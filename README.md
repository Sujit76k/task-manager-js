# Task Manager with Progress Tracker

A responsive, feature-rich task management application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This tool helps you organize your daily tasks with priorities, due dates, and visual progress tracking. It uses the browser's local storage to save your tasks, so you don't lose them when you close the page.
